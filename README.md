# lgmDA

This is a collaborative repository with functions to set up DASH for data assimilation experiments spanning the LGM to present.

Due to GitHub file size restrictions, large files accessed by code in this repository must be stored locally (such as the .netcdf collection of proxy data). These can be added to .gitignore so that they do not interfere with updates.
